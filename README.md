### A Software Developer driven by the logic of Mathematics.

My approach to software engineering is deeply influenced by my passion for Mathematics. I believe the quest for an elegant proof and the search for clean, efficient code come from the same place: a drive to solve complex problems with logic and clarity. As a developer specializing in the Java ecosystem, I apply this mindset to build robust and well-structured backend systems.

### ðŸ’¡ Where Code Meets Math

My interest in mathematics is not just a hobby; it's the foundation of how I approach technology:

* **Problem Solving:** I view complex coding challenges as intricate puzzles, similar to the problems found in Algebra or Number Theory.
* **Algorithms & Efficiency:** My background naturally draws me to areas like **algorithm optimization**, **cryptography**, and complex **data structures**, where performance and precision are critical.
* **Clean Architecture:** I strive to write code that is not only functional but also logically sound and simple to understand, much like a well-structured mathematical argument.
